# TuringTDA
This repository contains seven .py files used in the paper titled _Persistent homology classifies parameter dependence of patterns in Turing systems_.

## `CIMA.py`
This file solves the CIMA system PDE at mutiple nodes, computes their persistent homology, and saves the output to a `.csv` file.

## `CIMAsigma20.py`
This file solves the CIMA system PDE at mutiple nodes where the variable sigma == 20, computes their persistent homology, and saves the output to a `.csv` file.

## `Schnak.py`
This file solves the Schnakenberg system PDE at mutiple nodes, computes their persistent homology, and saves the output to a `.csv` file.

## `CIMAsample.py`
This file generates the two sample images of the CIMA system, complete with persistence diagrams.

## `Clustering.py`
This file produces all figures relating to the clustering, as well as the figure comparing the difference between minima and maxima of a solution.

## `Figures.py`
This file produces the majority of 2D plots for the CIMA system and the histograms.

## `MetricComparison.py`
This file tests the various linkage methods for standard and cleaned barcodes.
